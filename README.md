# sc2_bot - SmoothBrain bot

Simple sc2 bot using burnysc2 api.
Its name is SmoothBrainV0 and SmoothBrainFlat48 on the ai arena ladders.
In the "normal" folder is located the normal macro bot. In the "flat48" folder is located the Flat48 version of this bot, which basically performs an all-in attack.
This bot is able to beat the VeryHard AIs against every race, and even cheater AIs especially Zerg and Protoss.

If you are a novice bot writter I suggest you pick some ideas from this bot and copy a few blocks of code. However I do not recommend to straight up copy it and modify it because you need to understand how everything works else you will break everything. :)
